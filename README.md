## 🥗 Enhancing Public Health by Identifying Unhealthy Foods & Promoting Healthier Alternatives

### 📌 Introduction:

Unhealthy food habits are one of the most pressing public health concerns globally. With rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart-related issues, there is an urgent need to understand consumption patterns and make better dietary choices accessible to all. This project focuses on uncovering trends in unhealthy food consumption and encouraging the shift toward healthier alternatives through data-driven insights.

The aim is not only to identify what people are eating but also to recommend better options. This becomes especially important in communities facing limited access to nutritious food. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project seeks to bridge the gap between public health awareness and actionable food behavior change.

### 🎯 Objective:

* Identify patterns of unhealthy food consumption using real-world datasets.
* Use ML models (like Prophet, LSTM, SVM, and Random Forest) to forecast and classify food patterns.
* Promote healthier alternatives with tailored recommendations.
* Assist public health policymakers and consumers in making informed food decisions.

### ⚙️ Features:

#### 🔍 Classification Models:

Implemented classification algorithms (SVMs, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to identify unhealthy vs. healthy food categories based on nutritional profiles.

#### 📊 Ensemble Learning:

Applied Random Forest ensemble model to improve classification accuracy and gain more robust predictions.

#### 📁 Dataset Used:

* Cleaned the raw dataset from food consumption reports, nutritional data, and health indicators.
* Data transformed and labeled to support both classification and time series analysis.
